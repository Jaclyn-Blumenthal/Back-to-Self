<p>Here, at Back to Self, we do our best to make sure people in need of shelter and food are taken care of. We offer both individual apartments and residential apartments to families as well as individuals that are survivors of domestic abuse and people with mental illness. We also supply food from our homegrown garden, local food co-op, and graciously donated food from The Hannaford Super Markets.
